the p2p onramp and offramp differes from country to country, but lets for now focus on building it for india

we are using UPI/IMPS/NEFT/RTGS/BHIM systems, so while deposits, directly show a third party agent's QR (we have a mesh network of thirdparty PSP's (payment service providers), we have due diligence with them and the provide us the liquidity for this service) and it shows the amount in INR, once INR is deposited that account, autmatically the callback will redirect to success screen and update the balance in gamdock or it will simply reject and the same happens in reverse for withdrawals where the player add his IMPS/UPI/NEFT/RTGS/BHIM ID and received cash in account and once it received he has to releas his token in the escrow. OpenCash Gateway acts as the ecrow between PSP's and the Players and facilitates withdrawals and deposits
